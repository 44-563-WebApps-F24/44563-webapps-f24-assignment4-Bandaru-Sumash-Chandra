<b>CR.</b> Which of us twain, believ’st thou, in this talk
Hath more profoundly sinned against thy peace?

<b>OED.</b> If thou prevail’st with these men present here
Even as with me, I shall be well content.

<b>CR.</b>Unhappy man, will not even Time bring forth
One spark of wisdom to redeem thine age?

<b>OED. </b>Thou art a clever talker. But I know
No just man who in every cause abounds
With eloquent speech.

<b>CR.</b> ’Tis not to abound in speech,
When one speaks fitting words in season.

<b>OED.</b> Oh!
As if thy words were few and seasonable!

<b>[page 285][810-834]CR.</b> Not in the dotard’s judgement.
