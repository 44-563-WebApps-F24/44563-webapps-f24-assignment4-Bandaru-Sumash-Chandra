CR. Which of us twain, believ’st thou, in this talk
Hath more profoundly sinned against thy peace?

OED. If thou prevail’st with these men present here
Even as with me, I shall be well content.

CR.Unhappy man, will not even Time bring forth
One spark of wisdom to redeem thine age?

OED. Thou art a clever talker. But I know
No just man who in every cause abounds
With eloquent speech.

CR. ’Tis not to abound in speech,
When one speaks fitting words in season.

OED. Oh!
As if thy words were few and seasonable!

[page 285][810-834]CR. Not in the dotard’s judgement.
